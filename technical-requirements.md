# Technical Requirements

One html page:
1. create a constructor that creates product objects for me.
2. create array of product objects
3. create functions that pull three random images from the products array then
  a.  a listener that counts user clicks on each object
  b.  a function that pushes data of image clicked goes to local storage and populates placeholder
4. page needs to refresh with three different images
5. a function that recreates steps a & b repeat for a total of 25 clicks then stops images from refreshing after 25th click
5. a function that pulls data from local storage populates a chart.

JavaScript includes logic for randomizing pictures.

Chart displays data about selected product clicks:
  - times clicked
  - times viewed (stretch goal)

JavaScript includes object/method to store product clicks data to localStorage and render to chart.
